This is the bootstrap Java HTTP server.

Prepare your environment by running
	$ mvn clean install

Then, start the server by running
	$ foreman start

The server will echo back any data sent to it by a POST request. To test it, try the following:
	$ curl -d 'Hello, world!' http://localhost:5000/echo

To deploy to heroku, first log in.
	$ heroku auth:login

Then, create the app (make sure you do this in the root directory of the project)
	$ heroku apps:create --stack cedar

Now, deploy it!
	$ git push heroku master

You can test it with curl. Your app will have a unique name. Ours is called falling-dawn-4647
	$ curl -d 'hi' http://falling-dawn-4647.herokuapp.com/echo
